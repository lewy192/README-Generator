## Description 


My motivation for this project was: As a manager i want to be able to construct a visual representation of my team. 
    

I built this project because It allows me to have a styled html page of my team built for me based on my CLI inputs.
    

This project solves the following problem Having to manually create the aforementioned page. 
    

From this project I learnt I shouldn't try to assign instance properties asynchronously.
